SELECT AVG(energy) FROM songs to get the average energy value from their top 100 songs
SELECT AVG(valence) FROM songs to get the average valence value from their top 100 songs
SELECT AVG(danceability) FROM songs to get the average danceability value from their top 100 songs

Then with these values if for example energy more than a certain value, can characterise as energetic aura
vice versa for valence and danceability, using a criteria to characterise the aura.

It might not be fully representative of the listener as it is only using their top 100 most listened songs,
the 101th and beyond songs are not indicative, there is also no weightage. I suggest giving each song a weightage depending on their ranking
in their most listened songs, where the most listened songs will have the most weightage in its energy,
valence, and danceabilty to accurately represent the listeners actual audio aura.
